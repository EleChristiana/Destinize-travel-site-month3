Summary on Method: Methods are actions that can be performed on an object. There are different types of methods. eg; array lenght, array toString(), pop(),concat(), shift(), splice(), slice() etc.
The length property returns the size of an array
toString() converts an array to a string
pop() method removes the last element from an array
concat()method creates a new array by merging concatenating existing arrays.
shift() this method removes the first array ement and shifts all other elements to a lower index.

Summary on function: function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
function syntax : function name (parameter){
//code to be executed
}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function. When javascripts reaches a return statement, the code will not run again.

summary on control flow statement : There are three main types of control flow statements which are;
if/else statements
switch statements
loops.

If/Else Statements
If/else statements are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false.

The ifâ€¦else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.

Switch statements are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression.
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition.
